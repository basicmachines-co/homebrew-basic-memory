    # Note: We don't set SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION here because
    # we're installing from PyPI (pre-built), not building from source.
    # Setting it would leak into dependency builds (e.g., lazy-object-proxy)
    # causing version metadata mismatches.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Basic Memory has been installed as a command-line tool.
      
      To get started:
        basic-memory --help
      
      For use with Claude Desktop, add to your claude_desktop_config.json:
        https://memory.basicmachines.co/integrations/claude-desktop

      Homebrew 6 will require explicit trust for third-party taps before
      installing or upgrading from them. To keep upgrades working:
        brew trust basicmachines-co/basic-memory
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Basic test to ensure the binary works
    system bin/"basic-memory", "--version"
  end
end
